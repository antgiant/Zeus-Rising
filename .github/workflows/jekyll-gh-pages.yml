# This workflow was intentionally disabled to avoid using the older
# github-pages build stack. The project now uses `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`
# (precompiles the theme with Dart Sass before running Jekyll) to build and
# deploy the site. Keep this file only for history; it will not run automatically.
